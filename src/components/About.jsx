                    React, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js. I specialize in creating
                    both the backend and frontend of websites. With Express and
                    Node.js, I build the core functions and APIs, while using
                    React and Next.js along with Tailwind CSS for crafting
                    user-friendly and responsive interfaces. My goal is to
                    create powerful, scalable, and efficient web applications by
                    combining these technologies across the entire development
                    process."
